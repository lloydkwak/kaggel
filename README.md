# Kaggle Journey

Welcome to my Kaggle repository, where I document my learning process, competition participation, and data science experiments.

##  About This Repository

This repository serves as a personal journal for my data science journey through Kaggle. 
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebooks  
- Competition solutions  
- Notes and insights from kernels  
- Experiments with different machine learning models and techniques  

## Goals

- Improve data preprocessing and visualization skills  
- Master ML models 
- Deepen understanding of neural networks and deep learning  
- Develop reproducible workflows and pipelines   

## Tech Stack

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebooks  
- Git & GitHub for version control  
- Kaggle Datasets & Notebooks
